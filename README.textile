h3. Hide the section input?

p. If set to _yes_, the _Sections_ selection field on the "Write panel's":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Write editor is permanently hidden. Once a section is chosen from the prompt, the editor won't offer an option to change the section. You will still be able to change the section for an already published article with multi-editing tool residing on the "Articles list":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Articles.
